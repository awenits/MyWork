# Hangman

Hangman is a game for two in which one player tries to guess the letters of a word, the other player recording failed attempts by drawing a gallows and someone hanging on it, line by line.
Here the other player is the program itself. I have created it as a part of MITx's Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python. But I have modified its look, made it more prettier checkout!

# US_Bikeshare_analysis_project_udacity

In this project, I used Python to explore data related to bikeshare systems for three major bikeshare systems in the United States. I performed data wrangling to unify the format of data from the three systems and write code to compute descriptive statistics. Also I used some libraries for visualisation. Project is done in the jyupiter notebook, I have also added the data required and generated in data.zip file. Also the html version of notebook is provided.
