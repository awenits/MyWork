# Hangman

Hangman is a game for two in which one player tries to guess the letters of a word, the other player recording failed attempts by drawing a gallows and someone hanging on it, line by line.
Here the other player is the program itself. I have created it as a part of MITx's Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python. But I have modified its look, made it more prettier checkout!
